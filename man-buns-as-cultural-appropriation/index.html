    <p>Singer-songwriter Hozier played &quot;guess the man buns&quot; on VH1, and Buzzfeed facetiously claimed they had &quot;Scientific Proof That All Celebrity Men are Hotter with Man Buns.&quot; Brad Pitt, Chris Hemsworth, and David Beckham have all sported the man bun. And no, I&apos;m not talking about their glutes.</p>
  
    <p>As an occasional man-bun wearer, it's interesting how I'm suddenly part of a "trend." It takes a year+ to grow hair long enough to pull back, so if this is a trend now, there must have been precursors to the trend through the awkward not-long-enough-to-pull-back phases. Long hair requires commitment.</p>
