4:00 am - Padres queridos,
The Festival was a huge success... a ton of fun. I operated the band cam: projected video of the band onto the big screen behind them, creating surreal feedback... playing with that & the image fidelity to visually enhance the concert experience. There is no record of it, save for in the minds of the festival goers, so I can't share... but I think that is kind of romantic... everything else I do with a camera is so conceptualized / planned / edited / archived, it was refreshing to learn something / preform it / let it zoom into the ether all in one step. 

current mood: ï¿¼ thoughtful
current music: eyes to space - moving to iceland</blockquote>
