<article style=""><h1>Man buns as cultural appropriation - Sociological Images</h1><p>Singer-songwriter Hozier played "guess the man buns" on VH1&amp;comma; and Buzzfeed facetiously claimed they had "Scientific Proof That All Celebrity Men are Hotter with Man Buns&amp;period;" Brad Pitt&amp;comma; Chris Hemsworth&amp;comma; and David Beckham have all sported the man bun&amp;period; And no&amp;comma; I'm not talking about their glutes&amp;period;</p></article>

As an occasional man-bun wearer, it's interesting how I'm suddenly part of a "trend." It takes a year+ to grow hair long enough to pull back, so if this is a trend now, there must have been precursors to the trend through the awkward not-long-enough-to-pull-back phases. Long hair requires commitment.
