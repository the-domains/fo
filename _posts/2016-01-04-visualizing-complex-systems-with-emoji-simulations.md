# Visualizing complex systems with emoji simulations

[http://ncase.me/simulating/][0]

It is vitally important to the human race that we communicate about complex issues that affect us. This is a really interesting and engaging way to do that.

Simulations can be made that support any point of view, but that can be said of any medium, as a new medium of communication this is 👍. I'd love to see journalists using tools like this to explain policy.
