**Clinton is wrong** when she says that US policies promote entrepreneurship more than Nordic. How is a debt-saddled college grad, with the clock ticking on parent's health insurance, supposed to be comfortable starting a company?

We can't look back to an economy that supported lifetime employment. The 99% will be spend much more of employed life as contractors and freelancers. We need a basic safety net to support us in that _and_ encourage entrepreneurship.

> For people to support a Nordic-style approach is not an act of altruism but of self-promotion. It's also the future.
