description: "Each of these images was produced in little over a minute... Let's see how... On the 26th August, researchers Leon Gatys, Alexander Ecker and Matthias Bethge posted A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style on arXiv. They described an algorithm which allowed them to combine the style of one image with the content of another."
